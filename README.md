# Natural-Language-Processing
This repository contains my Artificial Intelligence course projects.
* MachineTranslation: trained a translation model using OpenNMT and Fairseq.
* NaiveBayes: news classification using Naive Bayes algorithm.
* QA_NLU: <br />
&emsp;&emsp;- developed a model for intent detection and slot filling.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;- fine-tuned a BERT-base model for a question answering task.
* Tokenization: implemented various tokenization algorithms (BPE, SentencePiece, and Spacy) and compared their performance against each other.

* Transformers: utilized transformer-based models for classification and entailment.
